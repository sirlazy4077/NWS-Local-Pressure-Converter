#This program is designed to output altitude-corrected barometric pressure calculated from the pressure
#of the local NWS nearest to the given latitude and longitude using the user's estimated elevation
#the local NWS barometric pressure and estimated elevation are found by passing the user's lat and lon
#to a generated url for the NWS, which are pulled via BeutifulSoup4 into the program
#This url is provided to the user for them to verify the input data
#
#if user input is not functioning, change the following values to run the program on your local computer:
#(i.e. use ctrl+F to find and update the corresponding variable value currently set)

#For the coders out there:
#TODO take input temperature from user to calculate Ctp instead of hard coding
#
#TODO take additional input temperature and input pressure to print a comparison report
#
#TODO define a strip and check input function (check input is a valid number)
#strip the input of whitespace
#1) check it's a float
#2) check the lat is between -90 and 90
#3) check the lon is between -180 and 180
#
#TODO define a check webpage function
#1) check that BeutifulSoup can parse the page (might not happen if above inputs don't output anything)
